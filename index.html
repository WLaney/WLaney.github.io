    About Me
</h2>
<p>I am currently a student at Cornell pursuing a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering. For my undergraduate degree I went to The College of William and Mary and received a B.S. in Physics, and a minor in Mathematics. Between undergrad and grad school I worked as a Test Engineer at <a href="https://carnegierobotics.com/">Carnegie Robotics</a> for a year and a half. In this role I designed and built test fixtures for use in the company's manufacturing area. For these test fixtures I selected the hardware involved, designed printed circuit boards in Altium, and wrote test software in Python. This, along with my undergraduate <a href="#sharkduino">Sharkduino</a> project, has given me a strong background in electrical engineering and programming.</p>

<p>On the personal side I try to stay busy outside of work and school. I really enjoy hiking and camping, I was an Eagle Scout and still try to get outside as often as possible. I am also starting to get more interested in photography and have started taking a camera out with me. When I'm not outside I enjoy watching a good movie (if you live in Pittsburgh I highly recommend the <a href="https://rowhousecinema.com/">Row House</a>). Finally I have a deep passion for electronics and technology. I spend a lot of time trying to teach myself new programming languages and playing with electronics. I build speakers, poke around with different hobbyist computers, and right now I am working through <a href="https://projecteuler.net/index.php">Project Euler</a> to improve my C.</p>

<p>During undergrad I did a lot of extracurriculars. I was the president of the William and Mary Robotics club. I was a member of the <a href="http://shm.wm.edu/">Small Hall Makerspace</a> Users Board, which is the body that runs the Makerspace on campus. I had a radio show on <a href="https://wcwm.wm.edu/">WCWM-90.9</a>, the campus radio station. I was a peer tutor at the <a href="http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/academicenrichment/tutors/">Tribe TutorZone</a>. I was a member of the <a href="http://aepitaupi.com/">Aplha Epsilon Pi fraternity</a>. Finally I just was the electronics group leader of TribeSat, William and Mary's first satellite project!</p>

    Portfolio
</h2>
<p>My <a href=portfolio.html>engineering portfolio</a> highlights the hardware projects I have been involved in. My <a href="https://github.com/WLaney">GitHub</a> gives a small example of my software experience, unfortunately the majority of the code I have written can not be shared publicly.</p>

<p>For my Masters of Engineering I conducted a design project titled "<a href="Laney_Design_Project_Report.pdf">An Improved Stereo Camera Pattern Projector for Use in Robotics</a>"</p>

<p>My undergraduate honors project focused on creating small low cost animal tags to be used in marine science research. My honors thesis is titled "<a href="https://publish.wm.edu/honorstheses/1140/">Continuing Improvements of the Sharkduino Animal Tag System</a>". In addition to my thesis I wrote an in depth <a href="laney_reu_final_paper.pdf">report</a> about the project at the end of my summer 2016 Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU).</p>
