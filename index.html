<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a Junior physics major at the College of William and Mary, with an expected graduation date of January 2016. Even though I am a physics major I have a strong interest in electronics and am considering pursuing a career in electrical engineering or a related field. I have gained a lot of experience in this through my work on the Sharkduino <!ADD LINK> project. </p>

<p>I also do a lot of extracurriculars at school. I am the vice president of the William and Mary Robotics club. I am a member of the <a href="http://shm.wm.edu/">Small Hall Makerspace</a> Useres Board, which is the body that runs the makerspace on campus. I have a radio show on <a href="https://wcwm.wm.edu/">WCWM-90.9</a>, the campus radio station. And finaly I am a member of the <a href="http://aepitaupi.com/">Aplha Epsilon Pi fraternity</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of school I try to do as much outside as possible. I am an Eagle Scout, and I still go camping and hiking whenever possible. I will try to post some pictures and information about my trips on this website.</p>

<p>Finaly I have deep love for computery things. I am constatnetly trying to teach myself new computers skills like, phython, bash, and evidently basic HTML. I'm offten not great at these things but I like learning them.</p>
