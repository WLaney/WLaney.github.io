	About Me
</h2>
<p>I am a Junior physics major, math minor at the College of William and Mary, with an expected graduation date of January 2018. I have a strong interest in electronics, so I am considering pursuing a career in electrical engineering or a related field. I have gained a lot of experience in this through my work on the <a href="#sharkduino">Sharkduino</a> project. </p>


<p>I also do a lot of extracurriculars at school. I am the president of the William and Mary Robotics club. I am a member of the <a href="http://shm.wm.edu/">Small Hall Makerspace</a> Users Board, which is the body that runs the Makerspace on campus. I have a radio show on <a href="https://wcwm.wm.edu/">WCWM-90.9</a>, the campus radio station. And finally I am a member of the <a href="http://aepitaupi.com/">Aplha Epsilon Pi fraternity</a>.</p>


<p>Outside of school I try to do as much outdoors as possible. I am an Eagle Scout, and I still go camping and hiking whenever I can. I will try to post some pictures and information about my trips on this website.</p>


<p>Finally I have deep love for computery things. I am constantly trying to teach myself new computers skills like python, bash, and evidently basic HTML. I'm often not great at these things, but I like learning them.</p>

	Sharkduino
</h2>
<p>The bulk of the research I have done at William and Mary has been on the Sharkduino project. This project focuses on creating small low cost animal tags to be used in marine science research. I created the initial prototypes, code, and analysis algorithms for the project. Now the scope and size of the project has expanded and I am in charge of the hardware portion. Most of my work right now is trying to improve the battery life of the system, testing new components that may be added to the system, and creating PCB boards to be used.</p>


<p>For more information about the project please check out the blog I mantian about it located <a href="http://www.wlaney.blogs.wm.edu">here</a>. Additionally I wrote a paper and created a poster about the project at the end of my summer research, they can be found <a href="laney_reu_final_paper.pdf">here</a> and <a href=sharkduino_poster_final.pdf>here</a>, respectively. I have presented this poster at the W&amp;M Physics REU poster competition, where it won first prize, and at the W&amp;M Physicsfest, where it received an honorable mention</p>

Finaly this project has been featured in multiple outlets. A story about it was published by W&amp;M News, it can be found <a href="http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2016/decoding-sharks.php">here</a>. The National Science Foundation (NSF) featured a video about the project in Science360, it can be found <a href="https://science360.gov/obj/video/a25b006b-22b0-422d-9d3f-ae0496c01a06/shark-acceleration-research">here</a>.
