# Facebook Says I'm Right

I've been thinking about social media some lately. Partly because of the recent [changes to the facebook news feed](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571?pnref=story), and partly because I've been spending more time on it.

The Facebook news feed changes struck a particular cord with me, because it validates something I've been doing for over a year now. I decided on my own that I was sick of seeing politics and random news stories on Facebook, so I decided to do something about it. Every Time I saw any link or story shared by one of my friends I would click on the three little dots on the top right of the post, and click the button that says unfollow or hide all.

I made sure to do this for all news sources and stories regardless of what I thought of them. The things is, it did not work super well at first. I just start seeing things people shared from increasing obscure sources. Eventley though, I managed to unfollow basically every outlet on the internet. So my news feed became dominated by a couple people who posted constantly, and updates from a few popular groups I was in. Oh well, at least I don't see as many bad memes. Maybe Facebook will finally solve this one for me, but I doubt it.

This all plays into a larger thing I try to do with social media. I attempt to separate out places where I see things from people I know in real life, and places where I see things from people I follow. On Facebook I only follow friends and family. Twitter is only for people whose work I'm interested in. Instagram is like Facebook. Tumblr has become, strangely enough, for organizations. And I don't count Snapchat as social media, it's a messaging app.

I don't if there are really any benefits to this sort of social media segregation. I just find it a little bit nicer not to see a friends engagement next to a crazy news story, next to the latest hot take by some D-list internet celebrity.
